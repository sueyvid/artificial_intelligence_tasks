# Research Report
## Knowledge Representation (KR)

### Technical Summary
Abstract: This report presents the development of a simple Expert System based on Production Rules to solve everyday diagnostic problems. The system utilizes a Knowledge Base structured in "IF-THEN" rules and employs an Inference Engine using Backward Chaining. The simulation demonstrates how the system starts with a goal (hypothesis) and works backward to verify the supporting facts, effectively mimicking human deductive reasoning.

**Key Concepts**: Knowledge Representation, Production Rules, Backward Chaining, Inference Engine.

## Rule-Based Expert System: Automated Diagnostic Logic
**Task Description**: Develop a prototype of a Rule-Based Expert System to perform a simple diagnostic task (e.g., automotive troubleshooting or computer maintenance). The objective is to simulate the behavior of an Inference Engine using Backward Chaining logic.

### Technical Requirements

1. Knowledge Base Definition:
    
    - Formulate a set of at least 5 to 6 production rules using the standard IF (condition/antecedent) THEN (action/consequent) structure.

    - Define the initial set of Facts describing the current state of the system (e.g., "The fuel gauge reads zero").

2. Inference Engine Simulation:

    - Perform a manual simulation of Backward Chaining.

    - Start with a specific Goal/Hypothesis (e.g., "The car battery is dead") and trace back through the rules to verify if the necessary conditions are met based on the initial facts.

3. Report Deliverables:

    - Rule Set: A clear list of all production rules created.

    - Execution Trace: A step-by-step log of the inference process, showing which rules were triggered and how the hypothesis was verified or rejected.

    - Final Diagnosis: The conclusion reached by the system.
